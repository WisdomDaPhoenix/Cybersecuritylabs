Modern Example: Browsing https://www.google.com
1. Application (TCP/IP) / L5-7 (OSI): Your browser (HTTP/HTTPS) uses DNS (Application layer) to resolve google.com to an IP address. TLS (Presentation/Session layer) handles the encryption.

2. Transport (TCP/IP) / L4 (OSI): Your device establishes a TCP connection to Google's IP address on port 443 (for HTTPS). It breaks your HTTP request into segments.

3. Internet (TCP/IP) / L3 (OSI): Your device wraps the TCP segments into IP packets and adds the source and destination IP addresses. A router then forwards these packets towards Google's network.

4. Network Access (TCP/IP) / L1-2 (OSI): Your Wi-Fi card (Physical) wraps the IP packets into Ethernet frames (Data Link) with your MAC address and your router's MAC address and transmits them as radio signals.

Google's server receives the signals and reverses the process, unpacking the data layer by layer until it can read the original HTTPS request.
