IP Addresses are generally divided into 2 families:
1. IPv4  (32-bit address, Octet-based)
2. IPv6  (Hexadecimal)

IP Addresses can be of two distinct categories
1. Private/Internal IP addresses
2. Public IP addresses

There are classes of IP addresses. Each class has its own address range.
Class A, Class B, Class C, Class D and Class E

In each class/address range, there are routable and non-routable addresses. Routable are those that can be used as public IPs over the internet while those that are non-routable are addresses which cannot be used publicly but only within an internal network. So for each class, there is a non-routable range of addresses.

For each subnet mask, e.g. Class A, Class B and Class C below, the Network part is fixed in value (255)
however the host value/number can change.

255.0.0.0     		means Network.Host.Host.Host   		(N.H.H.H)
255.255.0.0   		means Network.Network.Host.Host   	(N.N.H.H)
255.255.255.0     	means Network.Network.Network.Host      (N.N.N.H)

where 0 in the subnet mask represents the host/host part

hence for:
   Autoconfiguration IPv4 Address. . : 169.254.105.105(Preferred)
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.0.0
The class above is class B due to its subnet mask and address range

and also for:
   IPv4 Address. . . . . . . . . . . : 172.22.192.1(Preferred)
   Subnet Mask . . . . . . . . . . . : 255.255.240.0
The class is also class B

Ask as a question:  What class of IP address would a subnet mask of 255.255.240.0 fall under?


Task 1. 
What is the difference between a public and private IP address ?


Task 2
How does a switch differ from a router ?


Task 3.
